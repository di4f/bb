GO Base utils LINked.

Base utils without exceed (like "cat -v") options
and with additional options I needed in my scripts.

It is supposed to be as simple as possible.
Inspired by Plan9, Suckless and cat-v software.

Not Posix compatible since it's implemented thousand times.
Lack of a few features is a feature too.
